Morning!

We've set up another repository for you to clone.

Take a look at all the boilerplate we've written for you. Soon you'll be setting up these applications from scratch so if you're curious or confused about why some file is here, grab a mentor to ask them.

GOAL

Remember the CV you made all those months ago? This week you will be building an updated version powered by Node.js. You will fetch data from a real-world API (the github API), perform some operations on that data, and then use it to populate handlebars templates. This should sound familiar, because you did a similar thing last week.

CLASS TOPICS

writing modular javascript (controllers)
request / response lifecycle (middleware)
calling apis from within node
async
templating
general JS tasks - controller logic
